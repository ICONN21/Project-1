Test Your Knowledge! 
A production of K.I.D (Katherine, Ian, and Dilan)

We made it to project one! This project has provided a diffcult yet rewarding challenge, successfully putting our newly learned coding skills to the test! 

After some deliberation, we (K.I.D) landed on the idea of creating a quiz for our first major project. Given the requirement of using two different API, we landed on the Open Tirvia DB. There were several other quiz API's we came across while researching which one we wanted to use however OTDB proved to be the most seamless to integrate into our system. 

Although we arent able to choose specific subjects at this time given the time constraints on creating the project, as well as being on the free version($$$), we are very happy with how the quiz turned out. 

Ian focused mainly on the quiz API making sure the data was being propperly recieved as well as ensuring that the answer options were appearing on the window with selectable options. Once the option has been chosed and the class 'Slected' has been applied, the user can check their answer by clicking the 'Check Answer' button. The user also has the capability to restart the quiz at any point. When the user clicks the 'Restart' button, they are presented with a modal to confirm their decision. 

Dilan took care of the reulst page! This is one of the cooler features of our application in our opinion. The users score will be stored in local storage so that it can be pulled on the results page. Based
