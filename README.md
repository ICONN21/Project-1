Test Your Knowledge!
A production by K.I.D (Katherine, Ian, and Dilan)

We've reached project one! This endeavor has presented us with a challenging yet rewarding opportunity, allowing us to put our newly acquired coding skills to the test.

After careful consideration, we (K.I.D), settled on the idea of creating a quiz for our inaugural major project. With the requirement of utilizing two different APIs, we opted for the Open Trivia DB. While exploring various quiz APIs, we encountered several options, but OTDB proved to be the most seamlessly integrable into our system.

Despite the current time constraints and limitations of the free version, preventing us from selecting specific subjects, we're immensely satisfied with the outcome of the quiz.

# Roles
Ian primarily focused on the quiz API, ensuring proper data retrieval and the display of answer options on the window with selectable choices. Upon selection, the 'Selected' class is applied, allowing users to verify their answers by clicking the 'Check Answer' button. Additionally, users can restart the quiz at any point, with a modal confirming their decision.

Dilan handled the results page, one of the standout features of our application. User scores are stored in local storage, enabling them to be displayed on the results page. Depending on the total number of correct answers, a gif is dynamically generated, enhancing the competitive aspect and overall user experience.

Katherine, our HTML and CSS warrior, contributed to the sleek and efficient styling of our page. She also adeptly constructed the JavaScript to seamlessly capture information inputted into the Email and Username fields, storing it in local storage. This ensures that upon loading the results page, we have access to the username, email, and associated total score for each user.

# Layout
We have a laning page, quiz page, and results page. 

# Conclusion 
Overal the project presented many callenges, not the least of which was learning how to work as a group. Although the work was well split up, we did run into some issues with pushing and pulling code. In the end we are very excited to deploy our first group project!
